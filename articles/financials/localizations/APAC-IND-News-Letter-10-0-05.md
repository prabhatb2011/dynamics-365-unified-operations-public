## Simplified way to address Reverse charge transaction  as per govt. Clarification  – A general guidance  

With few changes in the released standard configuration Reverse charge feature can be made simple for accounting prospective . 
 
" As govt clarified that RCM on reverse charge transaction can be claimed in the same   month in which it is paid " refer below link : 
 
(https://twitter.com/askGST_GoI/status/897360102964944896)
 
Based on above clarification user can make following changes in the configuration : 
 
- Instead of posting GST tax in Interim recoverable at the time of posting purchase invoice , Post GST input tax directly in "Tax Recoverable account" 

### Steps :

- Create new posting account "Tax payable reverse charge" 

![Non GST item](media/IND-GST-Non GST.png)
![Non GST item](media/IND-GST-Non GST.png)

- Identify Reverse charge liability in separate account such as " Tax Payable (Reverse charge)" which should be defined as "Ledger account" instead of "Tax account" because Reverse charge liability cannot directly settled with input tax credit . It must be paid separately first from the "Cash Ledger account" .
 
###	Steps : 

### Under Posting :
- Tax measure – Interim recoverable  
- Debit : Tax Recoverable 
- Credit : Interim Tax payable 
### Vendor payment : 
- Tax measure – Interim Recoverable account
- Debit : Interim Tax payable 
- Credit : Tax payable reverse charge 

- Settle Reverse charge liability from cash account on the last day of the month in which reverse charge liability was created.
