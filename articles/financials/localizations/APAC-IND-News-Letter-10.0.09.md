By using Direct delivery functionality user can create deliveries directly from vendors to customers,
reducing delivery time and order administration. During direct delivery when purchase order is created Customer 
Delivery address defaults from Sales order form . However from the GST prospective company own address should 
default in tax information.

## GTE debug mode
Sometimes tax cannot be calculated and/or posted properly after you extend the GST configuration. If you change the data model,
sometimes there are discrepancies between the inputs from Dynamics 365 Finance and the GTE. If you update/add posting profiles, 
you might encounter posting imbalance issues. It’s time consuming to troubleshooting such issue.

Now with debug mode enabled, system will dump a log file which contains the discrepancies between the inputs fields from 
Dynamics 365 Finance and the GTE, and the hit posting profile. 

Step 1: Append &debug=vs%2CconfirmExit& to D365 AOS URL and press enter to open a new session

Step 3: Calculate tax for the transaction or re-calculate tax for the transaction, and then click Save to save 
the ‘GTETroubleshotingLog.txt, and provide the file to Microsoft for investigation.
